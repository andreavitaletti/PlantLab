The main purpose of this page is to present some of the tools (HW and SW) employed in the [FET OPEN Project PLEASED](http://www.pleased-fp7.eu) to investigate the use of plants as bio sensors.

To investigate the propagation of signals, similarly to what has been already done by [Stankovic et al.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC158572/), we used a [labjack U6](http://labjack.com/u6) with a custom made instrumentation amplifier
