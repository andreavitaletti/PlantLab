========

The main purpose of this page is to present the tools (HW and SW) employed in the [FET OPEN Project PLEASED](http://www.pleased-fp7.eu) to investigate the use of plants as bio sensors.

To investigate the propagation of signals similarly to what has been already done in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC158572/

We used a labjack U6 with a custom made instrumentation amplifier

the schematics of a single channel in Eagle

The final goal is to use plants as biosensors as  described in http://www.pleased-fp7.eu
